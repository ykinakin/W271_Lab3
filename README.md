# Lab Instructions

In this lab, you are going to apply what you have learned about panel models to a dataset of traffic accidents in the United States. This will allow you to use the tools that you have developed in the panel modeling section of this course. 

## Good News 

The good news, for you as students, is that this lab has considerably less range than the previous two labs that you have worked on. Rather than producing a full-report, we are going to ask you instead to do work that is much more guided. 

## Submitting Your Lab

To submit this lab, please submit a PDF of your work. In your submission, please show **all** of your R code -- there will not be very much data-wrangling, and this will make it easier for the instructors to grade your work.
